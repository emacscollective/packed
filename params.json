{"body":"This package provides some package manager agnostic utilities to work with Emacs packages.  As far as `packed` is concerned packages are collections of Emacs Lisp libraries that are stored in a dedicated directory such as a vcs repository.\r\n\r\nFeatures include determining a package's libraries, \"main\" library, `load-path`, autoload file and `info-path`. It can update `loaddefs.el` and *will* implement substitutes for `byte-recompile-directory`.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\nThis is a pre-release.  Version `1.1.0` (not `1.0.0`) will be the first stable release.  This is inspired by how Emacs versions are numbered.\r\n\r\nMost of the existing code has been extracted from [`auto-compile`](http://tarsius.github.com/auto-compile) so the parts that are used by that package are more feature complete than the rest. `packed` is also used by the (unreleased) package *tracker* `epkg` which uses it for the package *managment* part of what it does.  Unfortunatly the *byte compiling* part is not yet implemented.","name":"packed.el","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","tagline":"Emacs package management utilities","google":""}
